		<h4>Nick Borbe</h4>
		<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi guys.  My name is Nick Borbe and I am the revolutionary.  I enjoy fidgeting, cooking, hiking, long walks on the beach, driving the speed limit, and playing fetch with my dog. <br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, I am a certified yoga instructor, a semi-pro singer,songwriter, and guitar player, and I have written a novel that is currently in the process of being published. The title is Waking Up in Hindsight and you can read it online for free <a href = "https://clippings.me/nickborbe"> here </a>  There are also other short stories on that site as well as one live recording of a song I wrote.

		<p>This is a picture of me looking like a respectable human being</p>

		<p>Here's one of me hanging out with a couple of my second cousins</p>

		<p>Here I am with my cousins on my mom's side using yoga to remind people everywhere to live life to the fullest</p>
